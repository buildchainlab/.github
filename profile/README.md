## 👋 Welcome to BuildChain Labs

**BuildChain Labs** is building the foundational tools for smart contract development — starting with the Cairo ecosystem and expanding toward a multichain future.

---

### 🧱 What We’re Building

- ⚙️ **Cairo Compiler Service**  
  A Docker-powered Cairo build system supporting multiple versions of `starknet-foundry`, with fast, isolated compilation and testing in secure containers.

- 🧪 **Web-Based IDE (In Progress)**  
  A modern, Vite-powered developer environment for writing, testing, and deploying Cairo contracts — right from the browser.

- 🧰 **Modular, Open, and Extensible**  
  Our tools are designed to be language-agnostic and composable, laying the groundwork for support across other blockchain VMs and tooling ecosystems in the future.

---

### 🌍 Vision

> BuildChain Labs exists to make decentralized development as seamless and powerful as modern web development — from zero to mainnet, in minutes.
